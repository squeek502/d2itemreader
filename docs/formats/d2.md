## Item List Data Format

Byte Offset | Size (bytes) | Description
------------|:------------:|-------------
0x00 | 2 | Header. Must be `"JM"` (`0x4D4A` when read as a 16 bit unsigned integer).
0x02 | 2 | Number of items in the list as a 16 bit unsigned integer.<br/><br/>**Note:** This number only counts 'root' items, i.e. it *does not include* items that have been inserted into the sockets of the 'root' items. That is, an item list with 1 item that has 2 socketed items inside it will have a value of 1 in this field, even though the full data will have 3 items in it. In other words, the items in the sockets should be considered part of the item that they're contained in.
